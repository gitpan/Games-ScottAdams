Revision history for Perl extension Games::ScottAdams.

0.03  Thu Nov  2 00:30:45 GMT 2006
	- Revised directory layout to match that produced by h2xs
	  version 1.23 with flags:
		-X --name=Games::ScottAdams --compat-version=5.8.0 --omit-constant --skip-exporter --skip-ppport
	- Fix occasional bug in %nalias: the first of the equivalent
	  nouns to appear in the vocabulary list is now always the one
	  that is used as the %getdrop, so that it is recognised by
	  scottfree.
	- Finish Games::ScottAdams::Manual
	- Remove extraneous warning emitted when %AT places an object
	  that already had a location.
	- The compiler is not now so fussy about leading whitespace.
	  In general, all indentation is now ignored except when it's
	  part of a location description.
	- Move the sac executable down into new bin directory.
	- Use ".sao" (Scott Adams Object) instead of the uninformative
	  ".dat" throughout as the suffix for compiled files.
	- Tweaks in crystal.sac
	- Fix crystal/Makefile to use installed components.

0.02  Mon Jun  7 12:49:50 2004
	- First release.

0.01  Tue Apr 17 13:42:46 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

### Still to do
	- Allow room/item descriptions on %whatever line.
	- Naming and reusing of messages.
	- Handle multi-line messages.
	- Add meta-conditions such as "dark" that are implemented in
	  terms of primitive flags.
	- Mechanism for setting and testing flags by name.
	  (flag 15 always indicates if light has run out.)
	- Register current line-numbers with rooms, actions, etc. so
	  that compile-phase errors can be reported better.
	- Add discussion of %ident, %version, %wordlen, %maxload,
	  %lighttime and %include, and flags, counters and location
	  stores, to the tutorial.
	- Test all the action conditions and results.
	- Write decompiler; regression-test against compiler.
	- Figure out the MakeMaker magic to have
	  lib/Games/ScottAdams/Tuturial.pod automatically built.

It's possible to write perfectly good games (e.g. to clone Scott
Adams's own _Adventureland_) without any of these refinements.
