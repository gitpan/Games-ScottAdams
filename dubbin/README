You shouldn't really be wasting your time looking at this directory.
It contains a rather pointless game, "test.sac", broken up into a
bunch of sub-files so we can test that %include works the way it
should.

We also have a pre-built "test.sao", so that the module's "make test"
routine can regression-test its output against a known-good object
file.

(The test game is an early version of _Crystal of Chaos_ -- see
../crystal for the current version which is much more interesting.)
