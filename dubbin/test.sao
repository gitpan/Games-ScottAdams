"I have to breathe NOW!"

"I can't breathe ..."
"The plywood also catches fire and burns quickly."
"The oak catches, and becomes a roaring fire."
"Smoke pours upwards."
"I can't chop anything without an axe."
"I don't have a battering ram."
"I don't have anything to light it with."
"No!  Bees would sting me!"
"Smoke 'em out!"
"TIMBER!"
"There's nothing there all right! Maybe I should forget it?"
"It's locked."
"It splinters easily."
"There's a tunnel beyond."
"CRUNCH!  It's smashed to smithereens!"
"DOOSH!  It's absolutely annihilated!"
"It's also locked."
"Ouch!"
"CRUNCH!"
"There's a passage beyond."
"OF COURSE it's locked!"
"It's too solid for the axe to make much impression."
"DOOSH!"
"There's an entrance beyond."
"It says - `Leave *TREASURES* here, the say: SCORE`"
"Not while I'm carrying it!"
"I can't get it to catch fire."
"My match goes out."
"There's no way it will catch fire."
"OK.  It burns up very quickly."
"Bear won't let me"
"Bear eats the honey and falls asleep."
"It's bigger than I am."
"I'm already holding my breath!"
"OK"
">Fzing!<"
"You'll have to figure it out for yourself."
