# We'd like the next three %occur's to go after the %action for LIGHT
# BALSA below.  But that doesn't work, because although any number of
# %occurs may fire on a given turn, action-and-occur processing stops
# immediately after the first successful %action.  (I determined this
# by experiment: I couldn't determine the intent of the scottfree
# source to save my life.)  Instead, we do these %occur's at the very
# start of the _next_ turn -- which from the player's perspective is
# indistinguishable from the end of the previous one.
