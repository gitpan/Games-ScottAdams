=head1 NAME

sac - the Scott Adams Compiler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	sac crystal.sac > crystal.sao
	scottfree crystal.sao

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<sac> compiles the Scott Adams source file names on the command-line,
writing the resulting TRS-80 format game file on standard output.
This should usually be redirected to a file, often with a C<.sao>
(Scott Adams Object) extension, from where it can be run using an
interpreter such as C<scottfree>.

Any error messages are written onto standard error.

=head1 SEE ALSO

C<Games::ScottAdams>, the library that implements this program.
