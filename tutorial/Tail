=head1 BUGS

Bugs in the tutorial, that is, not bugs in the program ...

The following directives are not yet discussed:
C<%ident>,
C<%version>,
C<%wordlen>,
C<%maxload>,
C<%lighttime>
and
C<%include>.

There is not yet any discussion of flags, counters and location
stores.

Some discussion of what makes a good game design may be appropriate.
