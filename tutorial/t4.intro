This stage introduces automatic actions, which occur without the
player needing to do anything.  In effect, they happen I<to> him
rather than being done I<by> him.

It also uses inline documentation in the form of an action comment
(though why you'd want to do this is beyond me) and specifies the
start and treasury rooms explicitly.

This stage uses the directives from the previous stage, plus
C<%occur>,
C<%comment>,
C<%start>
and
C<%treasury>.
