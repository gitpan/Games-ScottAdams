Games::ScottAdams::Tutorial - The Scott Adams Adventure Compiler Tutorial


=head1 INTRODUCTION

This document walks you through the process of creating a small but
complete and playable game with six rooms, seven items including a
single treasure, and a couple of puzzles.  It makes no attempt to be
complete: you need the reference manual for that.  But by the time
you've worked your way through this tutorial you should be familiar
with rooms, items, actions and occurrences, and you'll be ready to
start writing your own games.
